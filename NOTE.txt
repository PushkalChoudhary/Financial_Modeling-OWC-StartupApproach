This project provides an approach to startup financial modeling using OWC (Oral Wellness Corporation) as an example.  
The Excel file contains revenue workings with scenarios and sensitivity analysis.  
This is not a full financial model â€” the objective is to show how revenue modeling can be approached, which can later be extended to costs, debt, equity, and valuation.
