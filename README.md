A structured financial model for a startup company, focusing on revenue projections and scenario analysis. This project demonstrates how to approach building a startup financial model using assumptions, drivers, and flexibility in Excel.

---

## Case Overview
**Company**: Oral Wellness Corporation (OWC)  
**Business**: Startup selling oral care products (toothpaste, toothbrush, mouthwash, etc.) through offline distribution channels.  

OWC has conducted preliminary market research to estimate demand and selling prices. This model is designed to project revenue under different scenarios and serve as a foundation for a complete startup financial model.

---

## Objectives of the Model
- Identify **key drivers of revenue**  
- Build **scenarios for volume and price**  
- Run **sensitivity analysis** on revenue outcomes  
- Demonstrate how this approach can be extended to other line items (costs, debt, equity, etc.)  

---

## Model Structure
The Excel workbook includes:

- **Inputs Sheet** → Assumptions for price and volume  
- **Revenue Working** → Revenue projections based on drivers  
- **Scenarios** → Different cases for demand and pricing  
- **Sensitivity Analysis** → Impact of changes in assumptions on revenue  

---

## Key Features
- Driver-based revenue modeling  
- Scenario analysis for price and volume  
- Sensitivity checks to test assumptions  
- Flexible structure to extend toward full financial modeling (costs, funding, returns)  

---

##  How to Use
1. Open the Excel model and review the **Inputs** sheet.  
2. Adjust assumptions for **price and volume**.  
3. Review how changes flow through to **Revenue Working** and **Scenarios**.  
4. Extend the approach to model other line items like costs, debt financing, and equity if required.
